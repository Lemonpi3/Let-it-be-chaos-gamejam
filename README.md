# Let-it-be-chaos-gamejam

This was my first attempt at a game jam , sadly i couldnt upload it in the time frame due to bugs on the main mechanic i've chosen for the game that made it unplayable and 
removeing it would mean that my game would not meet the gamejam theme, which was "Let it be Chaos".

The game was ment to be a 2d plataformer shooter like old metroids, but with some zones of the levels altering the physics,enemies and the player in a chaotic way. Like reversing 
gravity at random intervals , modifing the stats (speed, dmg , max health , etc)  and even changeing the weapons of the player to random ones. I also planned to give the enemies a 
random chance to spawn another one while in this chaos zones but i couldn't inplement it due to me loosing a lot of time trying to make the chaos zones work without makeing the game
unplayable.

Still i had a lot of fun with the challenge, and learn a lot from it since I'm more used to do 3d stuff in unity reather than 2d as well as learing how to manage time the hard way.
